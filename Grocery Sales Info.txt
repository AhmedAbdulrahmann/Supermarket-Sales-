🌟 This week, I have brought my Excel dashboard practice to an end and now the interactive Sales Dashboard is ready! 🚀

So I required something to monitor some essential sales indicators and to give an overview of sales dynamics, certain customers, and certain regions. 

That is what I have in mind:
- 📊 Total Sales, Average Sales, No Of Items, Average Rating, Fat Content, Item Type, Fat By Outlet, Outlet  Establishment, Outlet Establushment, Outlet Location.

- 🔍 Category, Region, Year, and Quarter filters are useful in providing perfect interaction with the data set.

- 📈 Sales Trends: Monthly, quarterly, and yearly views to highlight seasonality factors

- Top Categories & Segments which help manage the resources for maximum revenue.

- Customer Analysis of key customers to know and manage the best customers.

- Regional Performance displaying sales and profit by regions for comparison purposes.

As a result of this project, I learned a great deal more about data visualization, and data and graphic interaction which are valuable skills for a data manager. 💼
